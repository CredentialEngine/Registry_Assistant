When NOCTI determines that an assessment must be revised, a revision committee is convened with the same representation of content experts as the test development committees.  The revision committee re-evaluates the assessment and changes are made as recommended.  \n\nUser comments on assessments are reviewed, sent to subject matter experts if appropriate, and resolved on an ongoing basis.  Minor changes that do not affect the content or scoring rubric of the test are made between revision cycles; major changes are addressed during the revision process which typically occurs every three years.\n",
